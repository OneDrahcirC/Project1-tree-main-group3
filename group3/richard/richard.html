          <p>Hey, This is Richard C., I am a Junior in Lehman College studying in Computer Science Major, and Bussiness Admin.
             I currently work as a full time student.
              I love to stay fit and watch anime among other things. Some animes that I like are, Attack on Titan, Naruto, DBZ, Bleach, 
              Hero Academia and especially Akira.
